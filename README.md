# AdventOfCodeWhippet-Template

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fantastic annual programming challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

This repo is a blank C++ template for Visual Studio 2022 to give people a head start writing their own solutions to the puzzles. There's a utility library to help with common operations; this is my own AoC helper library that I've been building up over the last couple of years and it's totally undocumented at this point.

Good luck!
